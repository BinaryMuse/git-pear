# Git Pear :pear:

If you pair program, you know that it can be a pain to get Git to understand that a commit has multiple authors. Git Pear allows you to easily set `GIT_AUTHOR` and `GIT_COMMITTER` from within Atom (which only works if you commit from inside Atom, and only with a tool that passes on environment variables).
